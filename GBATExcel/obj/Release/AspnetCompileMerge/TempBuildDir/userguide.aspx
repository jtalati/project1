                Welcome to the Geographic Online Address Translator (GOAT)! GOAT allows you to enter
                a New York City geographic location, such as an address or street intersection,
                and returns back related geographic information, such as cross streets, side of
                street, tax block and lot (AKA Parcel &#8211;ID), five-digit ZIP code, census tract
                and block, police precinct, community district and City Council district.</p>

                            GOAT is organized into individual functions; each identified by the type of input
                            required along with a one- or two-character function code. Each function requires
                            a separate set of input data, such as an address or place name, a street intersection
                            or a tax lot, and returns a set of related geographic data.</p>
                        <p>
                            To change to a different function at any time, select the appropriate tab at the
                            top of the page, and GOAT will present an input page formatted for that function.
                            Provide the appropriate input data (by filling in data boxes and making selections
                            from pull-down menus, check boxes and radio buttons as required), then press the
                            Submit button. If GOAT accepts the input data as valid, it returns output data.
                            Otherwise, GOAT displays an error message indicating why the input data were not
                            accepted. Sometimes GOAT will provide additional information with the output data
                            as a warning message. A complete list of Geosupport (the software behind GOAT) Return
                            Codes (GRCs) and Reason Codes can be found

                            Tips for Efficient Data Entry of Street Names</p>
                        <p>
                            To minimize typing when entering street names, take advantage of the following features
                            available with all GOAT functions:</p>
                        <p>
                            Street directional and street type words may be entered in abbreviated form, such
                            as ST for STREET, AV or AVE for AVENUE, E for EAST, BL or BLVD for BOULEVARD. For
                            example, READE STREET may be entered as READE ST. In general, abbreviations that
                            would be recognizable to a person are also recognizable to GOAT.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If the street name being entered has a word containing numeric digits, you need
                            not enter the ordinal suffix (the characters 'st', 'nd', 'rd' or 'th' that can follow
                            a numeric value). For example, WEST 23RD STREET may be entered as W 23 ST.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You may enter partial street names when they are unambiguous in a borough. For example,
                            in the borough of Queens, GOAT recognizes MADISON as a partial name for MADISON
                            STREET, since this is the only valid full name that begins with MADISON. However,
                            in Manhattan, MADISON is ambiguous and is not accepted as an input street name,
                            since both MADISON AVENUE and MADISON STREET are valid full names.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            GOAT has three features to assist you with spelling street names and place names:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As you start to type, GOAT will pre-populate a dropdown list based on your entry.
                            For example, if you start to type &#8220;Broadway&#8221;, 10 names beginning with
                            &#8220;B&#8221; will appear. As you enter &#8220;BR&#8221;, the 10 names change
                            to entries beginning with &#8220;BR&#8221;. And as you type &#8220;BRO&#8221;, another
                            10 names will appear. At this point, &#8220;BROADWAY&#8221; will appear in the list
                            and you may select the name from the dropdown list or continue typing it in as you
                            choose.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you are not sure how to spell a name, you can also use the STREET (Name / Code)
                            function and select an option to &#8216;Browse Street Name Dictionary&#8217; to
                            search through an alphabetical list of all the names that GOAT recognizes as valid.</p>
                        <p>
                            Finally, if GOAT rejects a name that you have entered, the message will sometimes
                            list one or more valid names that GOAT considers to be similar to the rejected input
                            name. These are suggestions only; your intended name may not be any of these names.
                            If you do recognize a similar name as your intended name, you may correct your input
                            name by clicking on the appropriate &#8216;Copy to&#8221; (input field) and re-submitting
                            your inquiry.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            GOAT accepts the pseudo-street names BEND, DEAD END and CITY LIMIT as input street
                            names under certain circumstances. They may not serve as input names for ADDRESS
                            (Function 1B), but may serve as input names to INTERSECTION (Function 2). For STREET
                            SEGMENT (Functions 3) and STREET STRETCH (Function 3S), they may serve as input
                            cross street names only, not as the input 'on' street name.

                            This screen allows for two options.  A user can choose to
                            “Display Street and Property Information” or “Display Address Point Information.

                        <p>
                        <p>
                            The input data for Function 1B is an address or a place name. Two sets of geographic
                            information are returned; political geography associated with the entire block face
                            containing the input location, followed by property level and building specific
                            output.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The acceptance of an address by Function 1B does not necessarily signify that an
                            actual building exists having that address. You must check both sets of output.
                            The geographic and political information returned in the upper portions of the output
                            screen are related to an address range along a street block face. The information
                            toward the bottom of the screen is property-level specific. An address range along
                            a street block typically encompasses all possible addresses that could be assigned,
                            such as 2 &#8211; 98 (on the even side of the street). However, in reality, there
                            may only be buildings with the addresses 10, 34 and 76. Thus if another address
                            within that range is entered, it will get a &#8216;hit&#8217; on the street level
                            information, but not on the property level information.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If property level information is returned, it generally signifies that an actual
                            building exists having that address. However, the user should pay particular attention
                            to the &#8216;Type&#8217; column included in the Address Range List at the bottom
                            of the screen to see if an address is listed as a &#8216;Pseudo Address'. &#8216;Pseudo
                            Addresses' are addresses assigned by the Department of City Planning to some vacant
                            street frontages to enable a property to be accessed. These addresses have no &#8216;official'
                            status and should never be used outside of this system.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition to the &#8216;fixed' data returned, you have a choice of receiving a
                            list of addresses which applies to the property and/or a list of BINs (Building
                            Identification Numbers) that reside on the property identified by the input address.
                            You may also elect to receive BIN information related to the Transitional PAD file
                            (TPAD), and Roadbed Specific Information pertaining to the street level data. The

                            Instructions for Entering Function 1B Input Data:</p>
                        <p>
                            As input data to Function 1B, you may enter an address, consisting of an address
                            number and a street name or an address number and a place name; or you may enter
                            a place name alone without an address number.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some place names serve as street names in that they combine with address numbers
                            to form addresses. Some examples recognized by GOAT are: in Manhattan, CONFUCIUS
                            PLAZA, PENN PLAZA and WASHINGTON SQUARE VILLAGE; in the Bronx, BRONX TERMINAL MARKET
                            and FORDHAM PLAZA; in Brooklyn, METROTECH and FORT HAMILTON MANOR; and in Queens,
                            ASTORIA SQUARE. To make a Function 1B inquiry for 2 Penn Plaza, for example, select
                            Manhattan as the borough, enter 2 in the Address Number box, enter PENN PLAZA in
                            the Street or Place Name box and press the Submit button.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Most place names do not combine with address numbers to form addresses, but rather,
                            identify specific places by themselves. Some typical examples recognized by GOAT
                            are EMPIRE STATE BUILDING, CARNEGIE HALL, CITI FIELD, LA GUARDIA AIRPORT. To make
                            a Function 1B inquiry for a place name without an address number, first select the
                            borough, make sure the Address Number box is blank, and then enter the place name
                            in the Street or Place Name box. For example, to process EMPIRE STATE BUILDING,
                            select Manhattan as the borough, make sure that the Address Number box is empty,
                            and enter EMPIRE STATE BUILDING in the Street or Place Name box, and press the Submit
                            button.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When entering an address number that normally contains a hyphen, such as most address
                            numbers in Queens and a few address numbers in other boroughs, it is advisable to
                            include the hyphen.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When entering an address number for the Edgewater Park neighborhood of the Bronx,
                            make sure to include the proper section letter &#39;suffix&#39; after the numeric
                            address number (for example, 7A Edgewater Park). Valid suffixes for Edgewater Park

                            Select the Borough of Street 1 or Intersection Name. GOAT automatically modifies
                            the Borough of Street 2 to coincide with the Borough of Street 1 or Intersection
                            Name. Enter the names of two streets at the intersection, in either order, in the
                            boxes labeled Street 1 or Intersection Name and Street 2. If there are more than
                            two streets at the intersection, you may identify the intersection by entering any
                            pair of those streets. Except for three special cases discussed below, you may now
                            submit your inquiry by pressing the Submit button or the ENTER key.

                        <p>
                            Special case 1: If the intersection you are submitting lies on a borough boundary,
                            and the two streets whose names you have entered lie in different boroughs, then
                            before pressing the Submit button or the ENTER key, but after selecting the Borough
                            of First Street Name, you must select the Borough of Second Street Name. For example,
                            the Brooklyn street Ridgewood Avenue intersects with the Queens street Rockaway
                            Boulevard at the Brooklyn-Queens border. To submit an Intersection (Function 2)
                            inquiry for this location, select Brooklyn as the Borough of Street 1 or Intersection
                            Name, enter RIDGEWOOD AVE as the Street 1 or Intersection Name, select Queens as
                            the Borough of Street 2, and then enter ROCKAWAY BLVD as Street 2. (If you enter
                            the two street names in the other order, select the two boroughs accordingly.) Then
                            press the Submit button or the ENTER key.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Special case 2: If the streets you have entered intersect at two different points,
                            you must select a compass direction to identify which of the two intersections you
                            are inquiring about. For example, to process the easternmost of the two intersections
                            of Cromwell Crescent and Alderton Street in Queens, select EAST as the compass direction.
                            If you submit an inquiry for a pair of streets that intersect twice without having
                            selected a compass direction, a message will inform you that a compass direction
                            is required. If, on the other hand, you submit an inquiry for a pair of streets
                            that intersect once and you have selected a compass direction, you will in addition
                            to the output receive a warning message indicating that the compass direction is
                            not required.

                        <p>
                            Special case 3: Certain street intersections have intersection names. For example,
                            the intersection of West 54 Street and Broadway is known as &quot;Big Apple Corner&quot;.
                            For these special cases, you supply the intersection name in the field labeled Street
                            1 or Intersection Name and leave the field labeled Street 2 blank. If the Street
                            2 field is populated, GOAT will validate that the 2nd street does intersect at the
                            named intersection. If yes, a warning message is returned (NON-INTERSECTION NAME
                            IGNORED). However, if the name entered in the 2nd street field does not intersect
                            at the named intersection the input is rejected (W 154 ST NOT PART OF BIG APPLE
                            CORNER). Please note that &quot;Times Square&quot; is not an intersection name,
                            because it refers to an area which includes several intersections.

                            the Borough for the First and/or Second Cross Street. An example of the situation
                            would be the street segment Eldert Lane in Queens with Cross Streets Etna Street

                                    Watson Avenue. To submit a Function 3 inquiry that includes the dead end, enter
                                    CROES AVENUE as the &#8216;On' street names and DEAD END as one of the other cross
                                    street names and WATSON AVENUE as the other cross street name.

                            Function 3S accepts as input a street stretch and returns the cross streets along
                            the stretch. You may supply an On Street alone or an On Street and two cross streets,
                            which will limit the amount of data returned. If you elect to supply cross streets
                            and if either or both cross streets intersect the On Street exactly twice, you must
                            supply a compass direction to determine which intersection you want selected. If
                            one or both of the cross streets intersect the On Street more than twice, an error
                            message will be returned indicating this problem and no data will be returned. If,
                            on the other hand, you supply a compass direction and the On Street and cross street

                                    A dead end is a termination point of a street at which there are no cross streets.
                                    For example, Croes Avenue in the Bronx has a dead end near where it intersects with

                                    and, say, STORY AVENUE as the other cross street name. Using DEAD END as a cross
                                    street may be hard since a street stretch may have multiple dead ends.

                            The Department of City Planning maintains a set of names of geographic features
                            that Geosupport (the software behind GOAT) recognizes and considers valid. All of
                            these names are assigned Street Codes. Street codes enable street name aliases to
                            be grouped together in a meaningful way via the 5 digit or 7 digit street code.
                            Each 10 digit street code is unique to a specific spelling variation of a street.</p>
                            <p>
                                It is important to note that New York City geographic names are meaningful only
                                when the borough is identified, since features in different boroughs can have the
                                same name. For example, all five boroughs have a street named BROADWAY.</p>
                            <p>

                                format, but the software will interpret data entered and &#8220;normalize&#8221;
                                it for the user. The normalizing algorithm is quite complex and is beyond the scope

                                                    numbers to form addresses. Examples: the Manhattan names FEDERAL PLAZA and PENN
                                                    PLAZA. Examples of the use of these names in addresses:

                                                <li><i>Non-Addressable Place names (NAPs)</i> are place names that historically could
                                                    not be combined with address numbers to form addresses. Typical NAPs include the
                                                    names of islands, parks, airports, bodies of water, building complexes, major named
                                                    individual buildings etc. Examples: the Manhattan names EMPIRE STATE BUILDING and
                                                    CITY HALL, and the Queens name LA GUARDIA AIRPORT. Note that some NAPs (such as
                                                    EMPIRE STATE BUILDING) refer to buildings that also have conventional street addresses.

                                                    In recent years, addresses have been assigned to buildings that use the NAP name,
                                                    often in a different location from the NAP itself. An example in Manhattan is the
                                                    NAP called &#8216;Bryant Park&#8217;. There is a building &#8216;One Bryant Park&#8217;
                                                    which users typically enter as &#8216;1 Bryant Park&#8217;. Another example is a
                                                    NAP in Brooklyn called &#8216;Grand Army Plaza&#8217;. A cooperative now exists
                                                    nearby and its address is &#8216;1 Grand Army Plaza&#8217;.
                                                    <br />
                                                    If a NAP name is entered into GOAT along with an address, the application will ignore
                                                    the house number if it does not exist in the underlying data.<br />

                                                    usually but not necessarily by the City Council. Intersection Names allow an intersection
                                                    to be identified using one input &#8220;street&#8221; name instead of two as is
                                                    currently required. BEN KIMMEL SQUARE in the Bronx is an example of an Intersection

                                Many geographic features have two or more aliases, or alternate names, or spelling
                                variants of the same name. One common case of aliases is names containing a numeric
                                word between 1 and 10; these are all represented with two different spellings; with
                                the numeric word expressed in digits (such as 6 Avenue) and with the numeric word
                                spelled out alphabetically (Sixth Avenue).ue) and with the numeric word spelled
                                out alphabetically (Sixth Avenue).</p>
                            <p>
                                The following are examples of various types of aliases:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>SIXTH AVENUE and AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS are aliases, since they are alternative
                                    names for the same street.</li>
                                <li>SEVENTH AVENUE, FASHION AVENUE and ADAM POWELL JR BOULEVARD are aliases, since they
                                    are alternative names for the same street or (in the latter two cases) parts thereof.</li>
                                <li>SIXTH AVENUE and 6 AVENUE are aliases, since they are spelling variants of the same
                                    street name. Other examples of spelling variant aliases are MAC DOUGAL STREET, MC
                                    DOUGAL STREET and MCDOUGAL STREET; BEN-GURION PLACE, BEN GURION PLACE and BENGURION
                                    PLACE; ST MARKS PLACE, SAINT MARKS PLACE and SAINT MARK&#8217;S PLACE; and (in the
                                    Bronx) O&#8217;BRIEN AVENUE, OBRIEN AVENUE and O BRIEN AVENUE.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                The existence of an alias relationship between two names stored in the system can
                                be readily identified from their street codes: <i>Two names are aliases if and only
                                    if the first six bytes of their B10SC&#8217;s, known as the Borough-and-5-digit
                                    Street Codes (B5SC&#8217;s), are identical</i>. It can also be readily determined
                                whether two aliases for a geographic feature are valid for the same part (possibly
                                all) of the feature: <i>Two names are valid for the same part (possibly all) of a feature
                                    if and only if the first eight bytes of their B10SC&#8217;s, known as the Borough-and-7-digit
                                    Street Codes (B7SC&#8217;s), are identical</i>.</p>
                            <p>
                                For example, SEVENTH AVENUE, 7 AVENUE, FASHION AVENUE and ADAM POWELL JR BOULEVARD
                                in Manhattan are all aliases, so their street codes all have the same B5SC value.
                                In addition, SEVENTH AVENUE and 7 AVENUE are valid for the same part of the street
                                (in this case, the entire street), so they have the same B7SC value. FASHION AVENUE
                                is valid for a different part of the street (the portion in the Garment District
                                of Midtown), so it has a different B7SC value. ADAM POWELL JR BOULEVARD is valid
                                for yet a different part of the street (the portion north of Central Park), so it
                                has yet a different B7SC value. In the case of a complex (such as Lincoln Center)
                                and its constituent entities, the assignment of street codes is structured analogously
                                to that just described for streets. The names of the entire complex and the names
                                of its constituent entities are all treated as aliases of each other, since they
                                are all names of the same geographic feature (the entire complex) or parts thereof
                                (the constituent entities of the complex). &#8220;Being treated as aliases&#8221;
                                means that the B10SC&#8217;s assigned to these names all have the same B5SC value.
                                Within the umbrella of this B5SC value, the entire complex has its own distinct
                                B7SC value and each constituent entity has its own distinct B7SC value. For example,
                                all of the names for Manhattan&#8217;s Lincoln Center complex and its constituent
                                entities have the same B5SC value. In addition, LINCOLN CENTER and LINCOLN CENTER
                                FOR THE PFMG ARTS are alternative names of the same part of the complex (in this
                                case the entire complex), so these two names have the same B7SC value. AVERY FISHER
                                HALL and PHILHARMONIC HALL are alternative names of the same part of the complex
                                (in this case, a particular building), so these two names have the same B7SC value,
                                which differs from the B7SC values assigned to the names of the entire complex and
                                to the names of the complex&#8217;s other constituent entities.</p>

                                Users should also understand the difference between SORT and COMPACT Format. The
                                sole difference between these two formats is the presence or absence of alignment
                                blanks for names containing numeric characters. A conventional method of displaying
                                streets names is called the Compact Format because it does not contain leading blanks
                                before numeric street names. The Sort Format is more suitable for listing street
                                names for display or in a report because street names will &#8216;sort&#8217; logically:
                                names will &#8216;sort&#8217; logically:</p>

                                As this example illustrates, in the compact format, normalized street names do not
                                sort appropriately. For example, EAST 10 STREET sorts in front of EAST 9 STREET,
                                and 10 AVENUE sorts in front of 5 AVENUE. In contrast, in the sort format, the presence
                                of the alignment blanks causes street names containing numeric characters to sort
                                appropriately. Notice that the presence of the alignment blanks in the sort format
                                (shown as <span class="space_sort">b</span> in the example), and their absence in
                                the compact format, causes a change to the sort order of numeric street names not
                                only relative to each other, but also relative to non-numeric street names. For
                                example, in the compact format, FULTON STREET sorts in front of street names that
                                begin with a numeric character, such as 10 AVENUE, while in the sort format it sorts
                                behind them. Similarly, in the compact format, EAST HOUSTON STREET sorts in front
                                of the street names that start with the word EAST followed by a numeric word, while
                                in the sort format, it sorts behind those street names.</p>

                            <p>
                                The STREET (Name / Code) tab in the GOAT application offers a variety of options:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Convert Street Name to Street Code: Select a Borough from the dropdown list and
                                    enter a street name. You have the additional options of selecting a Street Name
                                    Length between 4 and 32 (the default is 32), or specifying Sort vs. Compact Format
                                    (the default is Sort). Hit the Submit button. The information returned is the Street
                                    Name in normalized format, the Borough 10 digit street code (B10SC) and the Geographic
                                    Feature Type.<br />
                                    <br />
                                </li>
                                <li>Convert Street Code to Street Name (D, DG, DN): Enter up to 3 street codes (B5SC,
                                    B7SC or B10SC). You have the additional options of selecting a Street Name Length
                                    between 4 and 32 (the default is 32), or specifying Sort vs. Compact Format (the
                                    default is Sort). Hit the Submit button. The information returned is the Borough,
                                    the Street Name in normalized format, the Borough 10 digit street code (B10SC) and
                                    the Geographic Feature Type.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    Note that if you choose to enter up to 3 street codes, they all must be the same
                                    format; you must enter either all B5SCs, allB7SCs or all B10SCs. If you enter an
                                    optional second or third street code, the software expects those to be in the same
                                    format that you entered the first street code. Therefore, if you enter a B5SC in
                                    the first field and a B7SC in the second field, GOAT will ignore the last two digits
                                    supplied in the B7SC. If on the other hand you enter a B7SC in the first field and
                                    a B5SC in the second or third field, GOAT will treat this as an error.<br />
                                    <br />
                                </li>
                                <li>Normalize Input Street Name (N*): Enter up to 3 street names that are not necessarily
                                    recognized by the system (i.e. either do not exist or have not been assigned street
                                    codes). You have the additional options of selecting a Street Name Length between
                                    4 and 32 (the default is 32), or specifying Sort vs. Compact Format (the default
                                    is Sort). Hit the Submit button. The information returned is the street name(s)
                                    in normalized format.<br />
                                    <br />
                                </li>
                                <li>Browse Street Name Dictionary (BB, BF): Select a borough from the dropdown list
                                    and enter a street name. You have the additional option to normalize the input street
                                    name as the input street, the primary street name (as per the B5SC), the principal
                                    street name (as per the B7SC) or the preferred street name. Hit the Submit button.
                                    Please note that there is no Sort vs. Compact option available in this function.
                                    The output will always be in sort forma.
